# GenericClient-objc
All-purpose Objective-C client, written in a Functional way using Futures (provided by the [Tools](https://github.com/broomburgo/Tools-objc) library).

An ErrorClient interface is included, to manage errors in Objective-C projects (currently using [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/welcome/), with the [Raven](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-objc) client)
