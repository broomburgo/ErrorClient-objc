# GenericClient-objc
All-purpose Objective-C client, written in a Functional way using Futures (provided by the [Tools](https://github.com/broomburgo/Tools-objc) library).

Please don't use this.
Read it, learn from it, puke on it if you need to, but don't use it as-it-is: write a new version from scratch, think about better abstractions, make it yours.

Please don't outsource knowledge, you'll regret it.
